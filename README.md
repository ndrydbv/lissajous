# Lissajous Curves

Lissajous curves, or Lissajous figures, are beautiful patterns formed when two harmonic vibrations along perpendicular lines are superimposed. They are the resulting graph of the following two parametric equations:

$x=Asin(at+δ)$ &emsp;
$y=Bsin(bt)$ 

The [User Interface](https://ndrydbv.github.io/lissajous) allows you to modify $a$ and $b$ parameters and see how the graph is affected.


Lissajous figures are sometimes used in graphic design as logos. So, Facebook's rebrand into Meta Platforms is also a Lissajous curve, echoing the shape of a capital letter M, described by equations:

$x=Asin(t+{π \over 20})$ &emsp;
$y=Bsin(-2t)$
