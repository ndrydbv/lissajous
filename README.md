# Lissajous Curve
Lissajous Curves, or Lissajous Figures, are beautiful patterns formed when two harmonic vibrations along perpendicular lines are superimposed. 

It is a graph of the following two parametric equations:

$x=Asin(at+Î´)$

$y=Bsin(bt)$ 

The user interface  allows you to modify $a$ and $b$ parameters and see how the graph is affected.
